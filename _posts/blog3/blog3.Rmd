# The main research
### 1.Introducing shiny app and what it does?
### 2.Self review in learning process.
- What did you do well?
- What are the points you can improve on?
- What are some things that you’d like to add that’s plausible?
- What are some things that you’d like to add that cannot be done yet due to limitation in data or technology?



## 1.Introducing shiny app and what it does?
In the shiny assignment, i creat a shiny app to research the situation of COVID19 in Italy. My research question is What is the situation about COVID19 in Italy(each month)? and what is the situation for each province?

### Data select
The dataset used for this analsis was retrieved from [covid19italy](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/covid19italy)The covid19italy R package provides a tidy format dataset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic outbreak in Italy. The package includes the following three datasets:

italy_total - daily summary of the outbreak on the national level

italy_region - daily summary of the outbreak on the region level

italy_province - daily summary of the outbreak on the province level

I download the dataset for csv file read in the blog.and collect the data between 24/02/2020 to 10/09/2020,which is the latest situation from Italy.

### App Usage Introduction
In the app has two main page, one is Covid19 analysis page,the other is the About page. In the covid19 analysis page has a table to introduced the basic situation of COVID19 in Italy,and the figgure is analysis the different province's situation.

### What point can improve about Shiny app?

2.The click plot need to improve, add
