# The main research
### 1.Introducing shiny app and what it does?
### 2.Self review
- What did you do well?
- What are the points you can improve on?
- What are some things that you’d like to add that’s plausible?
- What are some things that you’d like to add that cannot be done yet due to limitation in data or technology?



## 1.Introducing shiny app and what it does?
In the shiny assignment, I create a shiny app to research the situation of COVID19 in Italy. My research question is What is the situation about COVID19 in Italy(each month)? and what is the situation for each province?

### Data select
The dataset used for this analsis was retrieved from [covid19italy](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/covid19italy)The covid19italy R package provides a tidy format dataset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic outbreak in Italy. The package includes the following three datasets:

italy_total - daily summary of the outbreak on the national level

italy_region - daily summary of the outbreak on the region level

italy_province - daily summary of the outbreak on the province level

I download the dataset for csv file read in the blog.and collect the data between 24/02/2020 to 10/09/2020,which is the latest situation from Italy.

### App Usage Introduction
In the app has two main pages, one is Covid19 analysis page, the other is the About page. In the covid19 analysis, the page has a table to introduce the basic situation of COVID19 in Italy, and the figure is analysis the different province's situation.

`r knitr::include_graphics("image/tabpanel.png")`

### Figure Usage Introduction

`r knitr::include_graphics("image/figure.png")`

<br>

- on the left of the bottom, you can select the which month do you want to know the numbers of COVID19 case for each province.

`r knitr::include_graphics("bottom.png")`

<br>

- In the poltly, you can click each bar to know the detail of each province for that.

`r knitr::include_graphics("image/clickbar.png")`


### Table Usage Introduction
- About the table, you can click the top of the table(column name)to filter and arrange the case of COVID19 in Italy for each month.
the column name including month, MonthlyTotal, recovered, death, recovered rate and death rate. You can do your research in any combination you want.

`r knitr::include_graphics("image/top.png")`

- click the top of table

<br>

`r knitr::include_graphics("image/table.png")`


### About page
In the about page, you can see the introduction of the analysis of the COVID19 in Italy. and you can know the data source come from, also you can see some analysis of the case and get the conclusion.

`r knitr::include_graphics("image/about.png")`


### What you should do before you visit this app?
In this assignement, the package use including:
"shiny, shinythemes, plotly, ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate,bomrang, readr and DT".
Please install all this package before you visit or use the shinyapps.



## 2.Self review
- What did you do well?
- What are the points you can improve on?
- What are some things that you’d like to add that’s plausible?
- What are some things that you’d like to add that cannot be done yet due to limitation in data or technology?


### What did you do well?
1.The structure is clear and the clear theme, the shiny app is aim on the COVID19 in Italy, all the research is aim on Italy.

2.After the table and figure add the explain, which can let the visitor can be understand the actual situation more easlier.

3.Use DT table to make a good arrange and visualization.

### What are the points you can improve on?
1. The background only has white and black, not enough colour, can not catch the visitor's eyes. There should be more pictures in the main panel.

2.The click plot needs to improve, add for an element in it,  I just drew a simple line chart.

3. There are too few research directions.only research each province's situation and total confirmed.

### What are some things that you’d like to add that’s plausible?
1.I want to add one more chart to explain the summary table, which can catch the improtant point(like which month is increase fast or which month is peak at top) more easlier.The table is not intuitive enough.

2.Can add the map plot to analysis each province's situation of COVID19.

### What are some things that you’d like to add that cannot be done yet due to limitation in data or technology?

1.There are some data collection limitation, some province or monthly data is incorrect or has a missing value, which will influence the analysis accuracy.

2.The dataset will update every day, So you can't give the most comprehensive and prepared analysis.

3.Becauses of knowledge limitation, can not make the prediction model for the Italy COVID19 situation.
