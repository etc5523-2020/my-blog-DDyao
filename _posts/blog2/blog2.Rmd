# Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDâ€‘19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 31 August 2020, more than 25.3 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 848,000 deaths. More than 16.6 million people have recovered[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019)

In this blog, we will focus on the covid19 in Italy.

# Data description
The dataset used for this analsis was retrieved from [covid19italy](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/covid19italy)The covid19italy R package provides a tidy format dataset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic outbreak in Italy. The package includes the following three datasets:

italy_total - daily summary of the outbreak on the national level

italy_region - daily summary of the outbreak on the region level

italy_province - daily summary of the outbreak on the province level

I download the dataset for csv file read in the blog.and collect the data between 24/02/2020 to 10/09/2020,which is the latest situation from Italy.

```{r read data}
region<-read.csv(here::here("Data/italy_region.csv"))
province<-read.csv(here::here("Data/italy_province.csv"))
total<-read.csv(here::here("Data/italy_total.csv"))

```


```{r total analysis}
dat <- total%>%
  mutate(month=month(date))%>%
  group_by(month)%>%
  filter(cumulative_cases==max(cumulative_cases))%>%
  filter(recovered == max(recovered))%>%
  filter(death == max(death))%>%
  select(month,cumulative_positive_cases,recovered,death)%>%
  rename( MonthlyTotal=cumulative_positive_cases)
```


```{r totalanalysistable, fig.cap="Monthly analysis by covid19 in Italy",fig.align = "center"}
knitr::kable(dat,
             caption = "Make statistics about covid19 in each provinces"
             ) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))
```

```{r totalanalysisplot}
plot_ly(data = dat,
        x = ~ month,
        y = ~MonthlyTotal, 
        name = 'MonthlyTotal', 
        fillcolor = 'yellow',
        type = 'scatter',
        mode = 'none', 
        stackgroup = 'one') %>%
  add_trace( y = ~ recovered, 
             name = "recover",
             fillcolor = 'green') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~death, 
                name = 'death', 
                fillcolor = 'red')%>%
   layout(title = "Italy - covid19 analysis every month",
         legend = list(x = 5, y = 0.5),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Cases"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Month"))
