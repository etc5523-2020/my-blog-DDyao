# Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDâ€‘19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 31 August 2020, more than 25.3 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 848,000 deaths. More than 16.6 million people have recovered.[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) @ContributorstoWikimediaprojects2020Sep

In this blog, we will focus on the covid19 in Italy.

# Data description
The dataset used for this analsis was retrieved from [covid19italy](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/covid19italy)The covid19italy R package provides a tidy format dataset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) pandemic outbreak in Italy. The package includes the following three datasets:

italy_total - daily summary of the outbreak on the national level

italy_region - daily summary of the outbreak on the region level

italy_province - daily summary of the outbreak on the province level

I download the dataset for csv file read in the blog.and collect the data between 24/02/2020 to 10/09/2020,which is the latest situation from Italy.

# The main research
- primary question:
What is the situation about COVID19 in Italy?
- Secondary question:
Which region has the most patients?




```{r read data}
region<-read.csv(here::here("Data/italy_region.csv"))
province<-read.csv(here::here("Data/italy_province.csv"))
total<-read.csv(here::here("Data/italy_total.csv"))

```


```{r total analysis}
dat <- total%>%
  mutate(month=month(date))%>%
  group_by(month)%>%
  filter(cumulative_cases==max(cumulative_cases))%>%
  filter(recovered == max(recovered))%>%
  filter(death == max(death))%>%
  select(month,cumulative_positive_cases,recovered,death)%>%
  rename( MonthlyTotal=cumulative_positive_cases)
```

# What is the situation about COVID19 in Italy?

As we can see from the **Table \@ref(tab:totalanalysistable)**. Because lack of data before Feb 14, so we can see that the covid19 case in February is few. but the situation has grown rapidly in March. And then it continued to grow in April, and pick at April, which is 101551 total patients. In the next month, the infection decrease Significantly. Because Italy has effective prevention and control measures. The downward trend has been maintained in June and July. but it started to rebound in August.



Italians have been living under a national stay-at-home order since 9 March, with everyone required to remain within a few streets of their door.
The country brought in very limited easing of its virus control measures on 14 April, permitting some small shops - including bookstores, dry cleaners and stationers - to reopen. The businesses chosen were deemed to be lower risk as they rarely attract crowds.[BBC news](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52435273)@BBCNews2020Apr



```{r totalanalysistable, fig.cap="Monthly analysis by covid19 in Italy",fig.align = "center"}
knitr::kable(dat,
             caption = "Make statistics about covid19 in each month"
             ) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))
```

And we can research the recovered and death with **Figure\@ref(fig:plot-Month)**. We can see that, in the vast majority of patients, many can recover. The patient of recover has a high rate in the total patient. On the other hand, the death toll is growing slowly. This is evidence of the high level of medical care in Italy.

```{r plot-Month,fig.cap="Monthly analysis by covid19 in Italy",fig.align = "center"}
plot_ly(data = dat,
        x = ~ month,
        y = ~MonthlyTotal, 
        name = 'MonthlyTotal', 
        fillcolor = 'yellow',
        type = 'scatter',
        mode = 'none', 
        stackgroup = 'one') %>%
  add_trace( y = ~ recovered, 
             name = "recover",
             fillcolor = 'green') %>%
  add_trace(y = ~death, 
                name = 'death', 
                fillcolor = 'red')%>%
   layout(title = "Italy - covid19 analysis every month",
         legend = list(x = 5, y = 0.5),
         yaxis = list(title = "Number of Cases"),
         xaxis = list(title = "Month"))
```

# Which region has the most patients?

In the second part, we analyze each region in Italy to know that Which region has the most patients. As we can see from the **Figure\@ref(fig:province-plot)**.We can see it clearly, the region of Lombardia has the largest proportion, which is 33.8% of patients in Lombardia. The second is Emilia - Romagna, which is 15.5%. Lombardia is a much higher proportion than Emilia - Romagna. The region of Molise is the smallest proportion, which only 0.165%.



```{r province}
dat2 <- province%>%
  group_by(region_name)%>%
  summarise(total = sum(new_cases))%>%
  arrange(-total)
```

```{r province-plot,fig.cap="Region analysis of COVID19",fig.align = "center"}
plot_ly(dat2, labels = ~region_name, values = ~total,
    textposition = "inside",
    textinfo = "label+percent", showlegend = FALSE) %>%
  add_pie() %>%
  layout(title = "percentage of every region of covid19")
```

# Conclusion
Overall, the epidemic in Italy has been largely reduced with a series of measures.Although the epidemic has rebounded, the situation is positive.People's life has gradually returned to normal.Italy has succeeded in epidemic prevention and control.
