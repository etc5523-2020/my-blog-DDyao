dat <- coronavirus%>%
  filter(country == "France")%>%
  mutate(month=month(date))%>%
  group_by(month,type)%>%
  summarise(total = sum(cases))%>%
   pivot_wider(names_from = type,
              values_from = total)%>%
  mutate(death_rate = round(death/confirmed*100))%>%
  mutate(recovered_rate=round(recovered/confirmed*100))
