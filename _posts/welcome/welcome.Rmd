# Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDâ€‘19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 31 August 2020, more than 25.3 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 848,000 deaths. More than 16.6 million people have recovered(wikipedia)

In this blog, we will focus on the covid19 in France.

# Data description
The dataset used for this analsis was retrieved from [coronavirus](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus)The coronavirus package provides a tidy format dataset of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The raw data pulled from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus repository. which to analysis the case of covid19 in 2019.

```{r data description}

colnames(coronavirus)%>%
kable() %>%
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"))

```
There are 7 vars and 150720 obs in the dataset.
The var explain:
date - The date of the summary
province - The province or state, when applicable
country - The country or region name
lat - Latitude point
long - Longitude point
type - the type of case 
cases - the number of daily cases 


# Data analysis
As we can see from the table \@ref(tab:total), there are 337229 total amount between Jan 22 to July 31.



```{r total,fig.cap= "Total amount of covid19 between Jan 22 to July 31"}
coronavirus%>%
  filter(country == "France")%>%
  mutate(month=month(date))%>%
  group_by(country)%>%
  summarise(total = sum(cases))%>%
  knitr::kable(
  caption = "Total amount of covid19 between Jan 22 to July 31") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))
```



Base on the table\@ref(tab:province), in the ten provinces of France. The situation is most serious is French local, which has 314899 cases. The second is French Guiana, which has 14228 cases. And the least is Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which only has 5 cases.



```{r province,fig.width= 100}
coronavirus%>%
  filter(country == "France")%>%
  group_by(province)%>%
  summarise(total = sum(cases))%>%
  arrange(-total)%>%
  knitr::kable(
  caption = "Make statistics about covid19 in each provinces") %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hover"))

```


For the summary table\@ref(tab:summary), We analyze the trend of the epidemic in France by month. At January and February, there has been no significant increase in cases. At the march, there is a significant increase, which is 95 cases to 52727 cases. It peaked in April, which is 114472 case. In May to July, the number of cases is dropping, but there was a slight rebound in July. Between January and July, the most special in May. The death rate ad recovered rate is among the highest. After May, the death and recovered rate decrease both, because of the confirmed case decrease.The epidemic is basically under control in France.

```{r data analysis, echo = FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
dat2 <- coronavirus%>%
  filter(country == "France")%>%
  mutate(month=month(date))%>%
  group_by(month,type)%>%
  summarise(total = sum(cases))%>%
   pivot_wider(names_from = type,
              values_from = total)%>%
  mutate(death_rate = round(death/confirmed*100))%>%
  mutate(recovered_rate=round(recovered/confirmed*100))
  

```


```{r summary}
DT::datatable(dat2, options = list(pageLength = 7))

```
